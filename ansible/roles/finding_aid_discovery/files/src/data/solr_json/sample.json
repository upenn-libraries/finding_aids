Jones, entitled \"The Trail of Life in the Middle Years,\" is the third volume in an autobiographical series, of which the two preceding volumes are: \"Finding the Trail of Life\" and \"The Trail of Life in College.\" The narrative begins in the year 1893, when Jones became the editor of \"The Friends Review\" and began teaching philosophy at Haverford College. In it, he discusses the state of the Society of Friends at the time, and discusses his personal reconciliation of past Quaker separations, particularly during his time as the editor of \"The Friends Review.\"</abstract>\n                  <langmaterial>\n                     <language langcode=\"eng\">English</language>\n.    </langmaterial>\n               </did>\n               <bioghist id=\"aspace_beed279e1b5edb15537aad5be9783e62\">\n                  <head>Biographical Note</head>\n                  <p>Rufus Matthew Jones was born on January 25, 1863, in South China, Maine. His parents were Edwin and Mary Gifford Hoxie Jones. Their family had been Quakers, and he was brought up in a spartan and religious household. By his own estimate, Jones was deeply influenced as a child by his Aunt Peace Jones for her life of Quaker homily and, as a young man, the spirituality and philosophical powers of oratory and discourse of his other aunt and uncle, ministers Eli and Sybil Jones. He attended Oak Grove Seminary, later Moses Brown School, and then Haverford College, where he received a bachelor's in history in 1885. He wrote his senior thesis \"Mysticism and its Exponents\" under Professor Pliny Earle Chase. After graduation, he taught Greek, Latin, German, surveying, astronomy, and zoology at Oakwood Seminary from 1885 to 1886 and received a master's from Haverford in 1886. He went abroad in 1886/1887 with his friend Charles Jacob to study German and philosophy at Heidelberg University and to visit Ellen Claire Pearsall in Scotland, though he had been offered the position of principal at Damascus Academy in Ohio. During a month in France, he had a mystical experience in the bosky environment of Dieu le Fit during which he realized his life's work was in the realm of mystical religion. During his years of study of mysticism, he developed criteria by which the objectivity of a mystical experience might be verified.</p>\n                  <p>Jones visited Karl Schmidt and Paul Sabatier and attended the University of Heidelberg where he studied with Kuno Fischer and decided to study philosophy.</p>\n                  <p>Upon his return, Jones received a teaching post at Providence Friends School. There he met George Barton (Haverford College class of 1882), who became his close friend. He remained at Providence from 1887 to 1889.</p>\n                  <p>In 1888, Rufus Jones married Sarah Coutant. In that year, he wrote the biography of his uncle and aunt, Eli and Sybil Jones.</p>\n                  <p>From 1889 to 1893, Jones served as principal at Oak Grove Seminary. In 1890, he was recorded a minister at South China, Maine, Monthly Meeting and Vassalboro Quarterly Meeting.</p>\n                  <p>Lowell Coutant Jones was born in 1892.</p>\n                  <p>In 1893, Rufus Jones simultaneously was made editor of <emph render=\"italic\">Friends Review </emph>and began his 41 year teaching career in philosophy at Haverford College. At the magazine, he set forth his ideas of salvation as a transformation of life rather than theological transaction. He had a tolerant attitude toward all of the current Quaker factions and emphasized a thinking ministry.</p>\n                  <p>In 1894, <emph render=\"italic\">Friends Review </emph> merged with the \"pastoral\" <emph render=\"italic\">Christian Worker </emph>to become the <emph render=\"italic\">American Friend, </emph>with Rufus Jones as Editor.</p>\n                  <p>In 1897, Jones went to England, Italy, Ireland, and Switzerland, where he met various English Friends, including John Wilhelm Rowntree. He attended London Yearly Meeting, went to Oxford with Thomas Hodgkin, and went to Switzerland with Rendel Harris.</p>\n                  <p>Sarah C. Jones died of tuberculosis in 1899. Rufus Jones declined an offer of the presidency of Earlham. He had determined his mission was to unite all of the Yearly Meetings in America. \"Shall there be a Central Body?\" was his presentation at the Indianapolis Quinquennial Conference in 1897. He worked on this statement with James Wood (\"most weighty Friend in America\"), and finished and published in 1900 the Uniform Discipline by which: birthright membership discontinued; employment of pastors was provided for; and vote rather than consensus of delegates, as well as statement of belief.</p>\n                  <p>In 1898, Jones became a trustee of Bryn Mawr College upon the death of James Carey Thomas, and was also elected to Haverford's Phi Beta Kappa.</p>\n                  <p>In this period, summer schools on Quakerism were established. This was the result of the Manchester Conference in 1895, which demanded that Friends become involved in the work of the world with greater knowledge of their own heritage and analysis of the Bible through scientific eyes and to deal with social questions and social needs. It may be said that the long range result of this same conference was the American Friends Service Committee.</p>\n                  <p>Rufus Jones became engaged to Ellen Wood; Wood died in 1900 of typhoid fever. Jones published <emph render=\"italic\">A Dynamic Faith </emph>in which he explored \"religious mysticism [as] an attempt to realize the presence of God in the soul.\"</p>\n                  <p>In 1900-1901, he attended Harvard University to study under Josiah Royce, George Palmer and George Santayana (he had hoped to study under William James though the latter was not there in this period).</p>\n                  <p>In the summer of 1901, he was in England with his son Lowell and stayed with J.W. Rowntree. He lectured at Scarborough Summer School and became friends with Joan Mary Fry, Arnold Rowntree (John Wilhelm Rowntree's cousin), and Violet Hodgkin.</p>\n                  <p>Woodbrooke was established for the study of Quakerism and its principalship was offered to Jones. In July of 1902, soon after Rufus Jones married Elizabeth Bartram Cadbury, he went to England to consider the proposition, decided against the post, but agreed to be there for the opening during which time Lowell died.</p>\n                  <p>Rufus Jones looked for \"the more\" in people (more than what they were); also incorporated Kant's philosophy that consciousness depends on God rather than God on consciousness and Barclay's notion that the inner light was not a foreign implantation causing duality in man, but of one, active not passive dwelling. The test is not only one of life-results, but by spirit in many men -- a sharing in a wider spiritual order.</p>\n                  <p>In 1904, Rufus and Elizabeth Jones's daughter, Mary Hoxie, was born and John Wilhelm Rowntree died. Rufus Jones wanted to continue his history of Quakerism as an evolution in a series of volumes with himself as editor and writer of several volumes along with William Charles Braithwaite.</p>\n                  <p>He was lecturing a great deal and convincing audiences of \"modern thought\" and living religion.</p>\n                  <p>In 1907, he was again in England to study at the Bodleian; he gave the first Swarthmore lecture and finished <emph render=\"italic\">Studies in Mystical Religion, </emph>which was published in 1909.</p>\n                  <p>Jones denounced hysteria (visions, trances, auditions, etc.). He believed ecstasy a false trail. As Elizabeth Gray Vining stated, \"Not ecstasy, but an enhanced and unified personality and increased energy to carry out God's purposes in the world were to him the hallmarks of the mystical experience,\" while Jones expressed it as \"the power of the experience of the Divine Presence among the members.\"</p>\n                  <p>In 1911, he was in Germany, visiting with Theodor Sippell whom he had met formerly. Sippell postulated that Casper Schwenkfeld was the intellectual forebear of the Westmoreland Seekers whose thoughts later impressed George Fox.</p>\n                  <p>In 1912, Jones relinquished the editorial post with the <emph render=\"italic\">American Friend, </emph>but in 1914, he became the editor of <emph render=\"italic\">Present Day Papers, </emph>a monthly journal for the presentation of vital and spiritual Christianity (for England and the United States), but international publication became too complicated with the outbreak of war, so it ceased in 1915.</p>\n                  <p>Rufus Jones suffered a concussion in 1914 as well as a drain on his physical and emotional condition. He and Elizabeth Jones built a cottage at South China, Maine, named Pendle Hill after the place where George Fox had his vision.</p>\n                  <p>In 1915, Jones helped to start the Fellowship of Reconciliation with Henry Hodgkin. Jones became chairman of the Board of Bryn Mawr College in 1916 and maintained a close relationship with M. Carey Thomas. He attended the All-Friends Conference in London in 1920 to discuss fundamental problems of war and peace from a Quaker perspective. On the conference eve, he gave the Swarthmore Lecture on \"Nature and Authority of Conscience.\"</p>\n                  <p>In 1917, Rufus Jones investigated the concept of alternative service and organized the Emergency Unit at Haverford College providing students with a course of physical hardening and a training in mechanics and agricultural skills for volunteer work. Jones's idea of relief work in France was approved and this was the absolute beginning of the American Friends Service Committee. Morris E. Leeds and J. Henry Scattergood were the first to go to France. Some were appointed to go to Russia. Rufus Jones became the first chairman of the American Friends Service Committee. The relief work was in the categories of medicine, agriculture, relief, and building and reconstruction. Jones made a follow-up trip to France after armistice and worked with others on reconstruction. He wrote a history of this period of the American Friends Service Committee, <emph render=\"italic\">A Service of Love in War Time.</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>In 1919, Hoover suggested that the AFSC take over the childfeeding program in Germany. 40,000 Germans assisted in the preparation of food for 1,000,000 children daily.</p>\n                  <p>In 1921, Jones published the last two volumes in the Quaker History series <emph render=\"italic\">Later Periods of Quakerism.</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>In 1921, Jones went to Germany to inspect needs, then to Poland and Austria. He negotiated to get the AFSC into Russia for child feeding by joining with Hoover's American Relief Administration which ran into problems because of Hoover's anti-Communist leanings and because of the destruction of Russian transport systems during the war with the result that food remained loaded on ships in the harbor. </p>\n                  <p>In 1922, Rufus Jones received honorary LL.Ds. from Swarthmore and Haverford Colleges. In 1923, he was struck by an automobile, but in recovery, felt an increase in vitality and had a mystical experience. He also went to Greece, well-read in its history and then to Constantinople, Damascus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Cairo (where he saw Rendel Harris), Rome, and Oxford (where he worked on <emph render=\"italic\">The Church's Debt to Heretics).</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>In 1926, he was scheduled to give the quadrennial lecture of the National Council (Y.M.C.A.) in China. He also was in Japan and visited with Japanese Quakers, speaking also with Viscount Shibusawa on Nippon-American relations. His lectures, published as <emph render=\"italic\">Religion and Life, </emph>gave the basic structure of his philosophy. In China he was in Tai-Shan (where he saw Henry Hodgkin for retreat and study), then Peking where he met with Wellington Koo and met the Chinese Cabinet. He also met with ex-premier W.W. Yen; then on to Tientsiu, Nanking, and Lingnan, where he visited with his brother-in-law, William Warder Cadbury, proceeding on to Manila, Singapore, Ceylon, and India. In India he met with Mahatma Gandhi, who, Jones reported, was acquainted with the Bible, but knew little of Quakerism. Jones described Gandhi as sincere and simple, very Hindu. He proposed to Gandhi that he visit China. Jones saw India not as a land of mysticism (or immediate personal discovery of God) and he saw Gandhi as not being Catholic in his religious immersion; but later, he acknowledged that India possessed the knowledge that the soul is the eternally important fact.</p>\n                  <p>In 1928, Jones retired as chair of AFSC and the committee itself was divided into four sections: foreign, interracial, peace, and home service. The latter worked for miners. Henry J. Cadbury became the chair of AFSC and Clarence Pickett, executive secretary.</p>\n                  <p>In 1929, Jones gave the \"New Era Lectures\" at the University of Southern California School of Religion; he also lectured at Harvard and in Athens during a trip that took him from London to Greece and Assisi. Rufus Jones wrote a paper in 1929 in which he spoke of the need for better training of missionaries, so they would have a wider vision in their work.</p>\n                  <p>In 1930, Pendle Hill, an adult Quaker study center established in 1928, opened for religious and social studies with Henry Hodgkin as its first director.</p>\n                  <p>In 1932, Jones traveled to Asia. At the same time, the Japanese were invading China. The Joneses moved through devastated areas and reached Hong Kong, then went to Japan and Honolulu. A member of the Laymens Foreign Mission Inquiry, the group published Rethinking Missions as a result of their inspections and analyses. Essentially, the work stated that missionaries should be acquainted with the country in which they are proselytizing.</p>\n                  <p>Rufus Jones retired from teaching at Haverford College in 1934. He went to England, giving lectures at Woodbrooke, Copenhagen, Germany, Prague, London, Ireland, Strasbourg, Berlin, Vienna, Italy, France, and Switzerland, and researched 14th century mystics along the way.</p>\n                  <p>He was named editor of the Great Issues of Life series, but the war ended this project.</p>\n                  <p>Jones recognized the meaning of mysticism through reading Emerson, through his mystical experiences at Dieu-le-Fit and prior to his son Lowell's death, proclaiming \"quiet mystical receptivity,\" i.e. without event, its measurement on a scale from simple awareness to rapt consciousness. He suggested that mysticism not the whole of religion which has full intellectual involvement. Thus for Jones, the definition of mysticism was the conviction of an individual that the human spirit and Divine spirit have met. There are two types of mysticism: negative or denying of self; and Jones's type, affirmative or union with God without loss of personality. The mark of the affirmative mystic is a transformed personality, radiance, vitality, and energy. Jones distrusted ecstasy as a symptom of hysteria and abnormality. He thought of George Fox as an affirmative mystic. He believed mysticism flourished best in groups.</p>\n                  <p>In 1935, Jones again became chair of AFSC and sought to help Jewish refugees. He was also presiding clerk of Five Years Meeting.</p>\n                  <p>In 1936, he resigned as chair, but remained on the Bryn Mawr College Board of Trustees. He still gave plenty of lectures at age 73. He met with Theodore Dreiser (at Dreiser's request) as AFSC gave aid in Spain and Dreiser wanted a committee set up of prominent citizens to provide civilian relief in Spain.</p>\n                  <p>Jones was interested in bringing together people attracted to Quakerism and its philosophy, but who were not members of a Quaker meeting. This resulted in Wider Quaker Fellowship and, in 1936, the American Friends Fellowship Council.</p>\n                  <p>Jones presided at the second Friends World Conference held at Swarthmore College in 1937.</p>\n                  <p>In 1938, Jones was invited to South Africa by South African Quakers. He traveled to Capetown to meet with members of that meeting and also of Johannesburg and other South African meetings. He met with Senator Reinhault Jones who represented non-European races in Parliament and Gen. Jan Christian Smuts, minister of Justice and Deputy Prime Minister. Jones lectured at all the universities there, then went on to Singapore and Canton, Shanghai and Tokyo.</p>\n                  <p>After the Day of Broken Glass (Kristallnacht) in Germany (November 9 and 10, 1938), a special refugee division of AFSC was established. Three men were chosen to analyze the situation in Germany. These were Rufus M. Jones; D. Robert Yarnall, a businessman; and George Walton, principal of George School. Discretion was overturned by a newspaper account of their venture. The AFSC had already opened a refugee center in Berlin. The three men visited Jewish leader Wilfred Israel who reiterated that emigration was vital, much more so than food relief. They saw Consul General Raymond Geist who promised to assist them. They saw Myron Taylor, head of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees in London, who agreed with their plan. Geist arranged for their meeting with assistants of Heydrich, the real head of the Secret Police and \"hangman\" in charge of Dachau. After their presentation, the assistants conferred with Heydrich and he granted them investigation of \"sufferings of Jews and to bring such relief as they see necessary.\" Unfortunately, their effort brought no such results.</p>\n                  <p>In the 1940s, Jones wrote and spoke extensively, mainly interpreting the Quaker stand on war and peace. He received the Philadelphia Award in 1939 and the Theodore Roosevelt Award for distinguished service in 1942. In 1945, he was made honorary chairman of AFSC to raise money to feed German children.</p>\n                  <p>In 1947, General Meeting between the Hicksite and Orthodox branches of Quakers was established. Already the meetings had united their committees on peace, social order, and race relations, but not discipline or finance.</p>\n                  <p>In 1948, Jones organized a meeting of religious Christian leaders who would communicate with Palestinian religious leaders to somehow call an end to the fighting in the Middle East.

In May of 1939, the Methodist Episcopal Church; the Methodist Episcopal Church, South; and the Methodist Protestant Church united to form the Methodist Church (U.S.). In 1946 the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New constitution) and the Evangelical Church united to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church.

It was located at the intersection of Red Rock Road and a road that ran from East Swiftwater to Henryville, on land donated by Oliver D. Smith. The building was razed and in 1892 a new church building, known as Swiftwater Methodist Episcopal Church, was constructed at Swiftwater Road/Route 314. At various times, the church was included on a circuit with Tannersville, Analomink (Spragueville), Mount Pocono, Brick Church, and Arlington Heights. It functioned as a single point charge from 1965-1971. From 1971 until its discontinuance in 2005, Swiftwater United Methodist Church operated as a two-point charge in association with Keokee Chapel United Methodist Church in Paradise Valley.</p>\n                  <p>\n                     <emph render=\"bold\">Bibliography:</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>\"Swiftwater UMC Celebrates 150th Anniversary Sunday.\" November 24, 2001.

Doylestown became the county seat of Bucks County in 1812, and the area flourished when a railroad line was completed between Doylestown and Philadelphia in 1856. Doylestown's historic downtown began to deteriorate in the early 1960s, but the town was revitalized in part due to an architectural preservation movement. The Doylestown Historical Society local real estate collection, circa 1955-2013, contains mostly secondary-source materials--such as real estate listings, narrative house histories, photocopies of original documents with some original photographs--organized alphabetically by street address."],

Doylestown became the county seat of Bucks County in 1812, and the area flourished when a railroad line was completed between Doylestown and Philadelphia in 1856. Doylestown's historic downtown began to deteriorate in the early 1960s, but the town was revitalized in part due to an architectural preservation movement. The Doylestown Historical Society local real estate collection, circa 1955-2013, contains mostly secondary-source materials--such as real estate listings, narrative house histories, photocopies of original documents with some original photographs--organized alphabetically by street address.</abstract>\n                  <origination label=\"creator\">\n                     <corpname source=\"ingest\">Doylestown Historical Society (Doylestown, Pa.)</corpname>\n                  </origination>\n               </did>\n               <accessrestrict id=\"ref3\">\n                  <head>Conditions Governing Access Note</head>\n                  <p>Contact Doylestown Historical Society for information about accessing this collection.</p>\n               </accessrestrict>\n               <scopecontent id=\"ref4\">\n                  <head>Scope and Content Note</head>\n                  <p>This collection of information about Doylestown properties is organized alphabetically by street address.

Founded in the mid 18th century, it became the county seat in 1813 and was formally incorporated as a borough in 1838.</p>\n                  <p>\"Doylestown is named after the Doyle family. The Doyle family originally came from France (the name was D'Ouilli), but moved to Ireland during the Inquisition. Circa 1600 the name was changed to D'Oyley and later was changed again to Doyle. Edward Doyle sailed to America in 1640 and lived for a time in Rhode Island until he moved to Bucks County upon receiving a land grant from William Penn in 1692. He died in 1703. Edward Doyle's children remained in Bucks County and settled in the area of Doylestown. In 1730, Edward Doyle Jr. (born 1690) bought 150 acres of land in what is now Doylestown, and further purchases were made by the Doyle family in 1737. The Doyles built an inn in 1745 and the town was known early on as \"William Doyl's Tavern\" and \"Doyle's Town.\" In 1752, a second tavern was built, which still stands today (though now much modified). In 1776, the inn was sold by William Doyle (born in 1712, son of Edward Doyle, Jr.), who moved to Plumstead, Bucks County, where he died in 1780. After the sale of the tavern, the town became known by its present name. In 1778, George Washington and his Continental Army camped near Doylestown, on their way from Valley Forge to fight the British in New Jersey. In 1812, Doylestown became the County Seat of Bucks County.</p>\n                  <p>\"In 1856, a railroad line was completed between Doylestown and Philadelphia. The present train station dates from 1876. A trolley line was installed that ran to Trenton and Easton. The older part of town is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\"</p>\n                  <p>\n                     <emph render=\"bold\">Bibliography:</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>Quoted text from: Ludwig, Ed. \"Brief History of Doylestown.\" Accessed July 22, 2013. http://www.doylestownhistorical.org/0HistoryDoylestown.htm.</p>\n               </bioghist>\n               <acqinfo id=\"ref6\">\n                  <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition Note</head>\n                  <p>Files compiled from various sources over time by the Doylestown Historical Society.</p>\n               </acqinfo>\n               <processinfo id=\"ref7\">\n                  <head>Processing Information Note</head>\n                  <p>Summary descriptive information on this collection was compiled in 2012-2014 as part of a project conducted by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania to make better known and more accessible the largely hidden collections of small, primarily volunteer run repositories in the Philadelphia area.

Some of the primary correspondents include Peruvian writers Julio Ramón Ribeyro, Alfredo Bryce Echenique, Mario Vargas Llosa, Julio Ortega, José Miguel Oviedo, and Carlos Meneses; Mexican writers Marco Tulio Aguilera Garramuño, Manuel Mejía Valera, and Gonzalo Martré; Chilean writers Fernando Alegría and Antonio Skármeta, and Colombian novelist Gustavo Alvarez Gardeazábal.

There is business correspondence, documents, and printed material, and, in addition to correspondence with publishers, there is one folder of correspondence with the Spanish literary agency, Carmen Balcells, spanning the years 1964 to 1994.</p>\n                  <p> The collection includes a few manuscripts by Luchting, and one by Julio Ramón Ribeyro which were extracted from his letters to Latin American authors. Manuscripts by Luchting include a typescript prologue, probably for a book edited by Luchting and Carlos Meneses, El cuento peruano contemporáneo (1983), and a first draft of his translation into German of a short story by Ribeyro, \"Sólo para fumadores.\" Interspersed in the correspondence received from Latin American authors are a few papers of others, including poems and short stories by Peruvian writer Fernando Ampuero, and a typescript fragment of a novel by Isaac Goldemberg titled \"La conversión de Marcos Karushansky.\"</p>  \n               </scopecontent>\n               <accessrestrict id=\"b9113df72f4da751c5869999d02a034f\">\n                  <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>\n                  <p>The letters of G.

The group’s mission was to provide “a community which offers friendship and the opportunity to participate in horticultural, artistic, environmental, and civic endeavors.” By 1913, the club had grown to 20 members. Early Weeders were expected to present papers on topics; and by 1915, more than 100 papers had been prepared by members. The group’s motto “Learn to labor and to wait” was taken from a Longfellow poem and adopted in 1915. During World War I, the group trained and led a unit of the Land Army Farmerettes; during World War II, they helped build local victory gardens. In 1965, under the leadership of Lalite P. Lewis, the Weeders joined the Garden Club of Philadelphia, the Planters Garden Club, and other local garden societies to form the Philadelphia Committee of the Garden Club of America, allowing the member groups to work jointly on larger projects. During the summer of 2006, the Weeders’ Centennial Celebration Committee was formed to find ways to celebrate 100th anniversary and worked on such local projects as The Gazebo Garden in Bryn Mawr and the Fairmount Park Christmas House. The group’s membership has included many notable local women, such as Mrs. Nathan Hayward, Mrs. John Cadwalader, Mrs. C. Jared Ingersoll, Mrs. Stacy B. Lloyd and Mrs. Charles J. Biddle.</p>\n               </bioghist>\n               <prefercite id=\"ref28\">\n                  <head>Preferred citation</head>\n                  <p>Cite as: [Indicate cited item or series

Recognized for his success in repulsing the Confederate forces at Gettysburg, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general in 1864 and later major-general. In 1867 he commanded the Department of Louisiana and Texas, where his proclamation giving civil tribunals jurisdiction was heralded by local government but disapproved by Congress. He was relieved of command and transferred to the Department of Dakota (1870-1872), later the Division of the Atlantic (1872-1886), and finally to the Department of the East. In the National Democratic Convention of 1868 he received votes for the presidential nomination and in 1880 he was nominated for president by the Democratic Party, which he lost to James A. Garfield.\"</p>\n                  <p>General Hancock was born in Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in 1824. He died on Governors Island in New York City in 1886.</p>\n                  <p>\n                     <emph render=\"bold\">Bibliography:</emph>\n                  </p>\n                  <p>Wellner, Anita.

John Maclean was born in Scotland and educated to become a surgeon like his father. He came to the United States in 1795 and, on the advice of Benjamin Rush, established himself in Princeton in the practice of \"physic\" and surgery. In October 1795, Maclean was appointed professor of chemistry at Princeton. In 1798, he married Phebe Bainbridge, the eldest daughter of Absolom Bainbridge and Mary Taylor Bainbridge of Middletown, New Jersey. Phebe's brother was United States Navy Commodore William Bainbridge (1774-1833). John and Phebe Maclean's eldest son, John Maclean Jr. (1800-1886), became Princeton's tenth president in 1854.</p>\n                  <p> Materials in this collection include ten letters written by John Maclean (1777-1814), including letters addressed to Benjamin Silliman (1779-1864), the first lecturer at Yale in chemistry for whom Maclean served as mentor in the teaching of chemistry; Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751-1819) and Ashbel Green (1762-1848), the seventh and eighth presidents of Princeton; Major Benjamin Walker (1753-1818), United States Representative from New York; and Joshua Maddox Wallace. The letter to Ashbel Green concerns the student rebellion and suspensions in 1807. There is also a manuscript containing biographical details of Maclean's life, an extract of a letter of introduction by Dr. Miller of Glasgow to Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761-1818) of Philadelphia on Maclean's behalf, and Maclean's medical license from the State of New Jersey.</p>\n                  <p> Materials related to John Maclean Jr. (1800-1886) include his Princeton Theological Seminary diploma and an honorary doctorate from the University of the State of New York. There is also some legal correspondence of Archibald Maclean (1810-1894), family letters from William Bainbridge, and a power of attorney document for Mary B. Maclean. Of note is a bound volume containing a detailed genealogy of the Maclean, Bainbridge, and Taylor families.</p>\n                  <p> This collection was formerly referred to as the \"John Maclean Collection\" and the \"John Maclean Letters and Papers.\"</p>  \n               </scopecontent>\n               <arrangement id=\"58519eef356585fa724185b3f26e4258\">\n                  <head>Arrangement</head>\n                  <p>Arranged by family member.</p>  \n               </arrangement>\n               <accessrestrict id=\"15ea623024c91c8cbdd674a78a9d72e8\">\n                  <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>\n                  <p>Collection is open for research use.</p>  \n               </accessrestrict>\n               <userestrict id=\"ed8f4aa08a0c5fbae9ff7478eb41c384\">\n                  <head>Conditions Governing Use</head>\n                  <p>Single photocopies may be made for research purposes.

Born in Hastings, Michigan in 1877, Morey later went on to earn a BA from the University of Michigan in 1899. The following year, he received his MA from the University of Michigan studying classical languages and literature and spent three years at the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. In 1903, Morey came to Princeton as a fellow in Classics. Three years later, he accepted from Allan Marquand the position of Wilson-appointed preceptor in art history at Princeton until 1918 when he was appointed the rank of full professor. Morey taught renaissance and modern art as well as his specialties in early Christian and medieval art, practicing his own belief that his faculty should be knowledgeable in all fields. In 1917, Morey founded the Index of Christian Art, which was the first thematic and iconographic index of Early Christian and medieval art objects.</p>\n                  <p> While at Princeton, Morey worked tirelessly in educating students, faculty, and countless members of the academic community. Morey had a prolific publishing career, his first essay, \"The Christian Sarcophagus in S. Maria Antiqua\" was published in 1905 and his celebrated volumes Early Christian Art and Medieval Art were both published in 1942. Among countless other articles, reviews, chapters and contributions over his professorship, Morey also directed the Vatican's Museo Sacro catalogue of Christian art, which first appeared in 1936. For seven years he guided a group of five institutions (including Princeton) in a joint excavation of Antioch, and he supervised the ensuing publications. He helped found and cultivate the College Art Association and its publication, The Art Bulletin. In addition to teaching at Princeton, Morey similarly helped develop the art history curriculum at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Humanities.</p>\n                  <p> Throughout his professional career, not limited to the time he was at Princeton, Morey helped establish the budding art history discipline as a respected field of learning. He has been partly credited with making the profession one which students would be encouraged to follow. At the end of his tenure at Princeton, there were the five years (1945-1950) that Morey spent as Cultural Affairs Officer at the United States Embassy in Rome. Morey died in 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>  \n               </bioghist>\n               <controlaccess>\n                  <subject source=\"lcsh\">Art -- Study and teaching -- New Hampshire --

Forest Preparative Meeting was formed in 1851, as authorized by Baltimore Quarterly Meeting (Hicksite).

      "abstract_scope_contents_field":["Benjamin Rush, Philadelphia physician, in 1745 o.s. in Byberry Township. In 1768, he received his M.D. from the University of Edinburgh. He helped to establish the Philadelphia Dispensary and was a physician there until his death. Rush was also a member of the Provincial Congress in 1776, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and, in 1777, became Surgeon General of the Continental Army. He was a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia from 1787 to 1793. The Benjamin Rush papers date from 1787 to 1889, although the bulk of the material spans the years 1796 to 1810. These papers document some of Rush's work with patients through invoices, receipts of bills paid, and correposndence; as well as Rush's notes on various medical topics, including the liver. Previously catalogued as 10a 250."],

Snow</head>\n                  <p>English novelist and scientific administrator Charles Percy Snow (1905-1980) was a prolific author whose literary works explores themes of modern science and technology and their effects on the development of society.  Snow received his Ph.D. in physics from Cambridge University in 1930. Snow continued to teach at Cambridge and became the editor of <title>Discovery</title> magazine. When the magazine went under in 1940, Snow was already involved with the Royal Society, and by 1942 was named director of technical personnel, spearheading the mobilization of scientists to produce radar and military technology and the atomic bomb. Eventually Snow became the civil service commissioner in charge of recruiting scientists to post-war government work and returned to writing. His public service in the House of Lords and his literary works were aimed at the same goals: the interpretation of science and an awareness of technology's central role in human progress. Snow completed an eleven-novel cycle beginning with <title>The Light and the Dark</title> (1947) and ending with <title>Strangers and Brothers </title>(1970). The novel cycle is narrated by lawyer-bureaucrat Lewis Eliot and deals with pre- and post-war political and moral issues as well as the more personal issues of ambition and failure.</p>\n                  <p>\n                     <bibref>Wientraub, Stanley. \"Snow, Charles Percy, Baron Snow (1905–1980),\" in <title>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</title>, edited by H.

This miscellaneous collection provides a way of locating small accessions of slavery-related material acquired by the Library from various sources.</p>\n                  <p> The majority of the collection consists of bills of sale, plantation inventories, and other records created by European colonists documenting the sale and valuation of enslaved men, women, and children in the United States, including New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, Louisiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi; the Three Mile River Estate in Westmoreland, Jamaica; the Mount Charles (Middleton) Plantation in Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica, which was owned by Sir Henry Clinton (1738?-1795); and the plantation estate of John Lavicount in Antigua. Also present is a document containing statistics on enslaved populations for each state copied from the United States Census of 1790, as well as a 1820 deed of freedom for a formerly enslaved man in Brazil.</p>\n                  <p> There are also several indentures for domestic apprenticeship or enslavement of African American and multiracial children in Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, which date from the 1790s through the 1820s, including for two children apprenticed to United States Representative Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763-1845) of New York.</p>\n                  <p> Materials related to ships involved in the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans include a price list taken from the log of the English merchant ship Daniel and Henry, which was employed along the Gold Coast of West Africa (1700); an account book for the French privateer ship Républicaine (1798-1799); and a sales agreement and invoice for the cargo of the American ship Favourite (1804).</p>\n                  <p> Additional letters and documents pertain to efforts to extend slavery throughout the Americas, including copied documents regarding the status of enslaved and free people of color following the British capture of Martinique from French colonial rule in 1794; a letter between French generals working to suppress revolutionary efforts during the Haitian Revolution; and a letter between United States politicians regarding congressional debates over the expansion of slavery into the California and New Mexico territories in the late 1840s.</p>\n                  <p> The Documents on Slavery in Brazil file group consists of 77 miscellaneous legal and other documents, as well as one book, dating from 1758 to 1888, pertaining to the history of the history of slavery in Brazil as a Portuguese colony and later as the Empire of Brazil, until the abolition of slavery in 1887. Titles and description are transcribed exactly as they are on the dealer's inventory received with the materials. The folder numbers correspond with the item number in the dealer's inventory.</p>\n                  <p> This collection was formerly referred to as the \"Miscellaneous Slavery Collection.\" No additions will be made to this collection.

The sale included the Mount Charles Plantation (later known as the Middleton Plantation), as well as another parcel of land known as \"Middleton Penn,\" 247 enslaved laborers (all of whom are listed by name and occupation), and all future children born to the enslaved women listed.</p>\n                        <p> The indenture first recites a deed dated September 24, 1768, which was the original document of sale between Charles Pole (seller) and Augustin Gwyn (purchaser). Gwyn, still owing money for the original purchase, sold shares in the ownership of the plantation in order to pay off his debt to Pole. Investors, named as the third party, who paid varying sums directly to Pole, include Simon Fanshawe of Hanover Square, Lewis Vickers of Holyhead, Patty Parsons of Hanover Square, Dorothy Askew of Wakefield, and numerous others. The document then records the sale of the estate by Gwyn to the fourth party, named as General Henry Clinton of Weybridge, and Matthew Brickdale of Clifton. The fifth and sixth named parties are listed as Charles Fanshawe of Inner Temple, William Bond of Walbrook, and Thomas and Clayton Case, who were Liverpool merchants and owners of slave ships. Charles Pole, 1695-1779, fifth son of Samuel Pole of Redbourne Hall, was a Liverpool merchant and Member of Parliament. Matthew Brickdale, 1735-1831, was a Bristol clothier, undertaker, and Member of Parliament who reportedly inherited £100,000 after the death of his father; he also owned the Hope Estate in St. Vincent and another plantation on Nevis. In 1832, prior to the abolition of slavery by the British in 1833, 61 enslaved women and 47 enslaved men were held in bondage on the Middleton Plantation.</p>\n                     </scopecontent>\n                     <acqinfo id=\"cbc13fbf695064d39eaeb6bc9f78c6ce\">\n                        <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>\n                        <p>AM 2018-54</p>\n                        <p> Purchased in <date normal=\"2017-12\" type=\"acquisition\">December 2017</date>.</p>\n                     </acqinfo>\n                  </c>\n                  <c id=\"C1210_c002\" level=\"item\">\n                     <did>\n                        <unittitle>Copy of Statistics on Enslaved Population from 1790 United States Census</unittitle>\n                        <physdesc altrender=\"whole\">\n                           <extent altrender=\"materialtype spaceoccupied\">1 folder</extent>\n                        </physdesc>\n                        <unitdate datechar=\"creation\" normal=\"1790/1790\" type=\"inclusive\">1790</unitdate>\n                        <langmaterial>\n                           <language langcode=\"eng\">English</language>.</langmaterial>\n                        <dao xlink:actuate=\"onRequest\"\n                             xlink:href=\"https://figgy.princeton.edu/concern/scanned_resources/acfc1a24-6a53-4808-ab60-9e2dcef2fb6f/manifest\"\n                             xlink:role=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\"\n                             xlink:show=\"new\"\n                             xlink:title=\"View digital content\"\n                             xlink:type=\"simple\">\n                           <daodesc>\n                              <p>View digital content</p>\n                           </daodesc>\n                        </dao>\n                     </did>\n                     <accessrestrict id=\"514119f3a10ba2cbf8bcc79de634d360\" rights-restriction=\"Open\">\n                        <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>\n                        <p>Open for research.</p>\n                     </accessrestrict>\n                     <scopecontent id=\"a1a666d3f58c4d41f254cf316f6a3f84\">\n                        <head>Scope and Contents</head>\n                        <p>Consists of a 15-page manuscript copy (possibly made in 1830) of the first American census conducted in 1790, with statistics about the number of enslaved persons in each state, broken down by county.

Michel de Mallespine,\" and the first two pages include an affidavit by Marie Joseph Roignan, the wife of the Principal Register of the Sovereign Council of Martinique, Pierre Simon Roignan.</p>\n                     </scopecontent>\n                     <acqinfo id=\"5972a69f07c057a2c03f611173a50097\">\n                        <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>\n                        <p>AM 11409</p>\n                        <p> Gift of Charles August David Burk, Princeton Class of 1909, on <date normal=\"1937-04-26\" type=\"acquisition\">April 26, 1937</date>.</p>\n                     </acqinfo>\n                  </c>\n                  <c id=\"C1210_c004\" level=\"item\">\n                     <did>\n                        <unittitle>Indenture of Elizabeth Winchester by Daniel Squire as Apprentice to Ebenezer and Sibyl Green, Belchertown, Massachusetts</unittitle>\n                        <physdesc altrender=\"whole\">\n                           <extent altrender=\"materialtype spaceoccupied\">1 folder</extent>\n                        </physdesc>\n                        <unitdate datechar=\"creation\" normal=\"1796-09/1796-09\">1796 September</unitdate>\n                        <langmaterial>\n                           <language langcode=\"eng\">English</language>.</langmaterial>\n                        <dao xlink:actuate=\"onRequest\"\n                             xlink:href=\"https://figgy.princeton.edu/concern/scanned_resources/d913a30b-6420-4574-b8a8-2f60b63ece61/manifest\"\n                             xlink:role=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\"\n                             xlink:show=\"new\"\n                             xlink:title=\"View digital content\"\n                             xlink:type=\"simple\">\n                           <daodesc>\n                              <p>View digital content</p>\n                           </daodesc>\n                        </dao>\n                     </did>\n                     <accessrestrict id=\"afd67110c520fd81229b61ea855e4cf4\" rights-restriction=\"Open\">\n                        <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>\n                        <p>Open for research.</p>\n                     </accessrestrict>\n                     <scopecontent id=\"9897c1c90ffb2aa499f5d6138e7a38e6\">\n                        <head>Scope and Contents</head>\n                        <p>Manuscript indenture for a fourteen-year-old girl written by her guardian, apprenticing her to another family to learn the \"Misteries of Housework\" until her eighteenth birthday.</p>\n                     </scopecontent>\n                     <acqinfo id=\"4afd49e02b5653bb850804c32afd26fc\">\n                        <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>\n                        <p>AM 22077</p>\n                        <p> Gift of the Honorable George Henderson, Princeton Class of 1909, on <date normal=\"1950-06-21\" type=\"acquisition\">June 21, 1950</date>.</p>\n                     </acqinfo>\n                  </c>\n                  <c id=\"C1210_c025\" level=\"item\">\n                     <did>\n                        <unittitle>Pierre-Marie Le Bozec Account Book of the French Cosair Républicaine</unittitle>\n                        <physdesc altrender=\"whole\">\n                           <extent altrender=\"materialtype spaceoccupied\">1 folder</extent>\n                        </physdesc>\n                        <unitdate datechar=\"creation\" normal=\"1798/1799\" type=\"inclusive\">1798-1799</unitdate>\n                        <langmaterial>\n                           <language langcode=\"fre\">French</language>.</langmaterial>\n                        <dao xlink:actuate=\"onRequest\"\n                             xlink:href=\"https://figgy.princeton.edu/concern/scanned_resources/84fe3c89-31f2-4912-b8f1-0a1aff9c2c97/manifest\"\n                             xlink:role=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\"\n                             xlink:show=\"new\"\n                             xlink:title=\"View digital content\"\n                             xlink:type=\"simple\">\n                           <daodesc>\n                              <p>View digital content</p>\n                           </daodesc>\n                        </dao>\n                     </did>\n                     <accessrestrict id=\"6427d784941232a16d08550d57aa4d72\" rights-restriction=\"Open\">\n                        <head>Conditions Governing Access</head>\n                        <p>Open for research.</p>\n                     </accessrestrict>\n                     <scopecontent id=\"1702673f75e31b339764b597a07297d2\">\n                        <head>Scope and Contents</head>\n                        <p>Consists of an eleven-page manuscript account book, titled \"Livre C,\" documenting the financial accounts of the French cosair Républicaine under the command of French naval officer Pierre-Marie Le Bozec (1769-1830) in 1798 and 1799.

described in the document as \"cimarrones,\" who were recaptured in Cuba between 1856 and 1858. The document lists their names, physical descriptions, nationalities, and details about enslavers. The ages of the people described in the document range from 18 to 33 with the exception of one person who is listed as being an octogenarian. The physical descriptions are very detailed, noting distinguishing features such as scars. While most of the people listed in the document are of African descent, several are listed as \"Chino,\" making this important documentation of Chinese people in Cuba in the 19th century.</p>\n                     </scopecontent>\n                     <acqinfo id=\"4b6b8028fc052a3449e332e25b36d8c9\">\n                        <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>\n                        <p>AM 2020-57</p>\n                        <p> Purchased from Simon Beattie in <date type=\"acquisition\" normal=\"2020\">2020</date>.</p>\n                     </acqinfo>\n                  </c>\n               </dsc>\n            </archdesc>\n         </ead>"},

Hurford '60 Center for the Arts and Humanities (HCAH) \"supports the intellectual and artistic ambitions of faculty, students and staff, fostering collaboration, experimentation, and critical thought.\" Major aspects of HCAH include the Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery, the Philadelphia Area Creative Collaboratives Program, and the Tuttle Creative Residencies. HCAH also sponsors performances, workshops, and faculty and student seminars. The Cantor Fitzgerald Gallery predates HCAH as a formal program, having opened in 1994 to replace the Comfort Gallery.</p>  \n               </bioghist>\n               <scopecontent id=\"aspace_02f1eddadfd0eff120cc7451fecf90a2\">\n                  <head>Scope and Contents</head>\n                  <p>Annual reports include published reports which document the various activities and programs of the Hurford Center.

He enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and then transferred to the regular French army at the beginning of World War I. He served with distinction, rising to the rank of Captain and was on the Army's General Staff. For the rest of his life he was called Captain Cohn. He earned several honors from the French,  including the Legion of Honor (Legion d'Honneur). </p>\n                  <p>Captain Cohn began corresponding with Ernest Hemingway in the spring of 1930.  In his first letter to Hemingway, Cohn describes himself as a collector and introduces the idea of doing a bibliography of Hemingway's work. A definitive bibliography had been commissioned by Random House, with the stipulation that Hemingway write an introduction and sign copies of the work. The preface to Cohn's <title>A Bibliography of the Works of Ernest Hemingway</title> notes Hemingway's feelings about the idea: \"Mr. Hemingway was opposed to the idea from its inception, but on realizing my determination to do the book, whether or no, he was most gracious in verifying data for me and in correcting certain errors of mine. His point of view is best expressed in the comment appearing on the frontispiece 'Dear Captain Cohn, You may have this [a page of manuscript] for your book if you want it but truly, very truly, I think it all balls to publish bibliographies of living writers. E.H.' and the following from his letter to me accompanying it, 'Please do not take the typewritten notation on the mss. personally. It was my opinion when you first wrote to me that you were doing a bibliography, it was my opinion when you asked if I would see you about it in N.Y., and it remains my considered opinion today. So I would like it recorded since otherwise I might seem to favour such a compilation. A bibliography may be of interest to you because you love books but I do not love them at all'\" (pp. 10-11).</p>\n                  <p>During 1930, in addition to compiling the Hemingway bibliography, Cohn married Marguerite Arnold and opened the House of Books bookshop. Marguerite Cohn became a partner in House of Books and her husband gave her his extensive Hemingway collection. She was to continue adding material to the collection after Cohn's death in 1953.</p>\n                  <p>Through the combined efforts of Louis and Marguerite Cohn, the House of Books grew into one of the most important American bookstores specializing in modern first editions. Cohn also published a series of books entitled \"The Crown Octavos\" under the imprint of the House of Books. Number two of the series was Hemingway's <title>God Rest You Merry Gentlemen</title> published in a limited edition of 300 copies in mid-April of 1933, the first appearance of this short story. It was published, with some revisions, later in the same year in <title>Winner Take Nothing</title>. Cohn noted about its sale: \"With all the banks in the United States closed, I sent out a press release to a few newspapers and announcements to a few book-stores and received over a thousand orders for an edition of 300 copies\" (<title>Avocations</title>, 1 (January 1938), p. 353).</p>\n                  <p>Cohn was also responsible for the facsimile publication of Hemingway's \"Bastard Note\" issued as a commemorative greeting in December of 1931. This facsimile of the proof sheet of the legal disclaimer to be included in the second printing of <title>A Farewell to Arms</title> (1929) was signed by Hemingway, with a humorous comment about using \"bastard\" rather than \"illegitimate child\" in the disclaimer.</p>\n                  <p>Cohn attempted to publish one other Hemingway item. Twelve copies of <title>Four Poems</title> were to have been privately printed in August of 1930 to prevent them from being pirated. The poems (\"The Age Demanded,\" \"The Earnest Liberal's Lament,\" \"The Lay Poets With Footnotes,\" and \"The Soul of Spain with McAlmon and Bird the Publishers\") had originally appeared in the journal, <title>Der Querschnitt</title>. <title>Four Poems</title> was never published because it would have been denied copyright due to certain censored words that Hemingway had used in the poems. Only the manuscript and galley proofs survive and are part of the Cohn Collection.
