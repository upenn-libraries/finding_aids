A. Lamson, private\" stamped in gold on the cover and \"Letters\" stamped on the spine is a letterpress copybook containing the personal outgoing correspondence of William A. Lamson spanning six months from November 1882 to May 1883.  During this six-month period Lamson worked as secretary for the Mexican Central Railway Company and was living in a mining camp in Sonora, Mexico.  There is an alphabetical index with finding tabs at the beginning of the volume listing forty-nine correspondents along with the appropriate page numbers.  Following the index are 500 numbered leaves with the letters arranged in chronological order.  Lamson's outgoing correspondence consisted of letters to family and friends regarding his journey to Mexico, his experiences at the camp, duties of his job, living conditions, and observations of the Mexican people, culture, and customs.  Lamson described the landscape, architecture, clothing and behavior of the inhabitants.  Lamson wrote his parents often and in addition to his observations asked them to send him things he needed with specific instructions on how to wrap and send the items.  Lamson wrote many long letters to his friends Fred Crawford, Mr. Mason where in some letters he noted witnessing some violent encounters and discussed hearing of attacks by Apache tribes on women and children.  He also wrote Fred of a game played with colleagues and recorded the scores for each person.  Additional correspondence includes letters regarding salary and seeking a job after his return to Newton, Massachusetts.  There are two leaves of worn blotting paper laid in the volume.  Also laid in the volume are five telegrams from E. W. Cushing dated April and May 1883 concerning Lamson's future employment, five leaves written in pencil entitled \"Experience of a Boston Boy in Mexico,\" and a clipping of a St. Louis train schedule.

The label on the cover reads \"Louisa K. Berry, 1863\" and \"Scraps\" is on the spine.  The volume comprises a scrapbook of images, clippings, and memorabilia kept by Louisa K. Berry Hartley.  Pasted on the pages are one to several items and some pages mix clippings and images in decorative arrangements.  Some items have been tipped in the volume.  There are clippings of quotations, poems, world culture, and history.  Color images of flowers, women in regional costumes, animals, and cartoons with labels or captions appear throughout the volume.  There are many illustrated landscapes of architecture and historical sites in Egypt, Europe, and Asia.  Christmas and New Year's greeting cards, lace papers, and a few puzzle cards are also included.  At the end of the volume are several printed elegies spanning the years from 1838 to 1861.  The volume also includes some original drawings.  Two items are elevations in pen-and-ink and wash, one of a fountain dated 1853 and one of statue dated 1847 both attributed to Robert Hartley, most likely John P. Hartley's father.  Two unattributed works a pen-and-ink drawing of a landscape on paper with a lace edge and a water color are pasted in the volume.  Interestingly, there are two pages with buildings of institutions for the deaf and a chart depicting the sign language alphabet tipped in the volume.  Three notes are in the scrapbook written by Louisa K. Berry Hartley's daughter Eleanor Frances Hartley Lemasnie born in Tullamore, King's County (Offaly), Ireland in 1880.  One note laid in the volume by Lemasnie is to her niece Elizabeth dated Christmas 1945.  Lemasnie explains she is passing on the scrapbook to Elizabeth.  Lemasnie removed her Uncle Thomas Hartley's wedding announcement from the volume and copied the information on the page.  Pasted on the last page is an etching entitled \"Lower Town Quebec\" signed by artist Stanley F. Turner (1883-1953).  Below the etching Lemasnie wrote of the Hartley family's emigration from Ireland in 1882 and the death of Louisa K. Berry Hartley.</p>  </scopecontent>\n  <custodhist id=\"aspace_003b5d1ae849ad52087bccf5679a1fd2\">\n    <head>Custodial History</head>\n<p>Formerly owned by Eleanor Frances Hartley Lemasnie.</p>  </custodhist>\n  <acqinfo id=\"aspace_7a8b39b97953fbf8abb9b19e82035a86\">\n    <head>Source of Acquisition</head>\n<p>Sold by Eclectibles (Tolland, Massachusetts), 2016</p>  </acqinfo>\n  <prefercite id=\"aspace_ea19a39d5676c3af479f8b77228a66b3\">\n    <head>Preferred Citation</head>\n<p>Ms. Codex 1792, Louisa K.

The album provides a record of Harrison's service in Pakistan spanning less than a year from late 1918 to mid-1919.  There are two photographs mounted in each page measuring approximately 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 inches with handwritten captions in white ink.  A heading on each page indicates a town or district.  Harrison was chiefly in the Pakistan districts of Jhelum and Mardān.  The photographs record other soldiers, camp sites, local people, customs, landscapes, architectural sites, and animals. Sites include canals, mosques, a bazaar and other places of interest.  The images also recorded Harrison's life in British India including fellow soldiers, platoons, sporting events, bungalows, and gardens.  Pictures of animals include geese, cows, dogs, and captured alligators.  Other photographs captured images of the Khattak Platoon, Gurkhas, and the Depot QR Guard.  One page has a picture of an Afghan shell exploding dated May 1919, probably during the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

The diary comprises Wylie's descriptions two journeys.  The first trip is a tour through Europe spanning four months from February to June in 1832.  The second journey records Wylie's voyage to Havana, Cuba with his brother Macleod from December 1832 to January 1833.  Wylie's trip through Europe included Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium.  Wylie noted his impressions of the cities he visited, the accommodations, and the people.  A significant portion of Wylie's trip--from March to May-- was spent traveling throughout Italy.  Wylie spent Easter week at the Vatican and in Rome where he described holy day blessings by the Pope, including Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, and Easter.  Detailed descriptions and impressions of visiting museums, seeing works of art, attending operas, and touring ancient sites throughout Italy are included.  Wylie specifically mentions his visit to Palazzo Barberini to see Beatrice Cenci and his admiration for the Colosseum.  Wylie was also enamored with Florence visiting the museums daily.  He wrote of visiting friends and acquaintances while in Italy including Lady Vavasour among others.  Wylie noted his 22nd birthday on June 13, 1832 while Düsseldorf. In addition to his tour through Europe, Wylie wrote of his voyage on the Rosehill to Cuba with his brother Macleod.  Wylie chiefly wrote of the weather, sea sickness, the seas, passing Caribbean islands, and reading until his arrival in Havana, Cuba on January 31, 1833.  Wylie recorded what he read on board the Rosehill almost daily.  Works include the Bible, Childe Harold's pilgrimage (which he confesses he stole), and Beauties of Sterne.  A large portion of leaves in the middle of the volume are blank.  Reading the volume from back to front Wylie lists the cities he has visited, people he visited, information concerning money in other countries, ships traveled on, and the captains.  \"The Valencian love song\" a poem written in Spanish spans four pages at the end of the volume.  Two armorial bookplates depicting stags with Wylie's full name are laid in the volume.</p>  </scopecontent>\n  <acqinfo id=\"aspace_2f1246298eff1b2a60b75320e0ff8bbe\">\n    <head>Source of Acquisition</head>\n<p>Sold by Ian Brabner, Rare Americana (Wilmington, Delaware), 2016.</p>  </acqinfo>\n  <prefercite id=\"aspace_509263d5684bc7244878a9a94bb4f0ee\">\n    <head>Preferred Citation</head>\n<p>Ms. Codex 1796, Alexander Henry Wylie diary, 1832-1833, Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, University of Pennsylvania</p>  </prefercite>\n  <controlaccess>\n    <genreform source=\"local\">Manuscripts, English -- 19th century</genreform>\n    <genreform source=\"aat\">Poems</genreform>\n    <genreform source=\"lcgft\">Diaries</genreform>\n    <genreform source=\"aat\">Codices (bound manuscripts)</genreform>\n    <geogname source=\"lcsh\">Havana (Cuba) -- Description and travel</geogname>\n    <geogname source=\"lcsh\">Italy -- Description and travel</geogname>\n    <subject source=\"lcsh\">Voyages and travels</subject>\n    <geogname source=\"lcsh\">Europe -- Description and travel -- 19th century</geogname>\n    <subject source=\"lcsh\">English diaries -- Male authors -- 19th century</subject>\n    <subject source=\"lcsh\">English diaries -- 19th century</subject>\n  </controlaccess>\n  <dsc><c id=\"aspace_ref9_i1o\" level=\"file\"><did><unittitle>Alexander Henry Wylie diary</unittitle><unitdate datechar=\"creation\" normal=\"1832/1833\" type=\"inclusive\">1832-1833</unitdate><container id=\"aspace_ce2d54aa6213efa8569a190e4c15d034\" label=\"Mixed Materials\" type=\"volume\">1</container></did></c></dsc>\n</archdesc>\n</ead>\n"},
